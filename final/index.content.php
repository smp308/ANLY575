<h3>Summer Olympic Data and Possible Factors</h3>
<p>The goal of this website is to provide information and insight about the medals earned in the Summer Olympics spanning from the 1890s until today. The Olympic data I will looking at is country specific, and gives a count of all medals earned throughout various summer Olympics by said country, as well as a break down by medal type (gold, silver, bronze). One of the tables also includes type of medal earned by year, event/sport, and athlete, but has been condensed for easier viewing. <br>
This site also introduces various other influences: weather and country happiness. Do countries with a warmer/more tolerable climate seem to perform better in the summer olympics? Looking at the world happiness, happiness score is generated by a variety of factors: GDP, healthy life expectancy at birth, perceptions of corruption, and more. Do countries with stronger GDPs perform better, or do aspects like perceptions of safety have a larger impact?<br>
From the visualizations generated, you'll be interested to find that happier/safer countries do not mean greater winnings. While it is true that low earning medal countries like Afghanistan or Senegal have weak GDP, low degrees of freedom, and overall low happiness, so do countries like Luxembourg or Mauritius, which have GDPs and other statistics similar to top medal earning countries like the US and Germany. In terms of weather, countries like Sweden and Finland who have low average annual temperatures have collected more Olympic medals than some of their warmer-tempered competitors. There are also a great number of countries with warmer climates who perform well, indicating that weather has little to no affect on country performance in the summer Olympics. Looking at citizens feelings from day to day, countries possessing unhappier citizens tend to have less medals, but happier countries (compared to all countries) do not neccessarily have more medals.
